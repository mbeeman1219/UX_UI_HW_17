               <p>I am an Arizona-based Filipina-Navajo user experience researcher. I have lived in Arizona all my life, and I graduated from Arizona State University with a degree in Biology. I originally was on track to become a physician’s assistant until I realized I wanted to use my medical background to help patients and providers in a different way other than patient care. So, I went on to learn about UX/UI at the University of Denver.</p>
               <p>Due to my science background, I have always been someone who is curious about the human mind and learning about how people think and why they do it in the way that they do. Then, I learned to combine my love of logic and psychology with the creative aspect of the user experience and meshed them together into a new path in my life centered around user research.</p>
               <p>When I’m not trying to delve into user research, you can find me trying new restaurants, watching anime, playing video games, or napping with my cat.</p>
